                                    With a developing country like Vietnam,
                                    problems such as destruction of the natural
                                    environment (deforestation, water pollution,

                                    of gender equality, along with the
                                    consequences of natural disasters (flood,
                                    drought, fire, explosion,...) are becoming
                                    more and more serious and difficult to
                                    control. The consequences are also a problem
                                    and a burden for the country. The founders
                                    of VNxpedia started participating in charity
                                    programs very early. Being aware of the
                                    seriousness of the above consequences,
