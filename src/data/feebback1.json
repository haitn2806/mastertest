      "Comment": "My adult son and I recently returned from a wonderful two week trip to Vietnam arranged by Asia Tour Advisor. Originally planned for 2020 but delayed by the pandemic. Through two years my contact, Ms Xuan from Asia Tour Advisor, kept me informed about restrictions affecting my travel plans and helped me plan adventures in the mountainous areas of the north such as Ninh Binh and Mai Chau, a magical two day luxury Boat trip on Lan Ha Bay in the Gulf of Tonkin, and a city tour of Hanoi, with excellent guides and drivers. We then flew to HCMC, with overnights on the river in Can Tho, and a fine hotel in HCMC. The Cai Rang early morning market on the Mekong is quite an adventure, bringing a cultural awakening to our American senses. Saigon, (as it is called by many locals) is a thriving metropolis with spectacular architecture and fine restaurants. Throughout our two week journey, Ms Xuan was always just a text or a phone call away, The people throughout Vietnam are genuine and friendly and even the cities are very safe. I will be returning in the spring with some American military veterans",
